Welcome to the **PCB Design Tutorial Series** repository! This project accompanies our YouTube playlist, guiding you through the entire process of designing and creating a PCB from scratch to the final product. [Watch the playlist here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIrF2fQzfvAtiUSOiGNiCDhFbwCMzE6sP)

Design an **ESP12 Board** with built-in power and multiple output options:
- **Voltage Output:** 5~12V DC
- **Current Output:** 0.5A

This repository includes all the necessary files, resources, and guides to help you follow along and create your own PCB.

## Repository Structure
- **`/PCB_Files`**: PCB design files created in Altium Designer.
- **`/Schematics`**: Circuit diagrams in PDF and source format.
- **`/Datasheets`**: Datasheets for components used in the project.
- **`/Slides`**: Presentation slides used for explanations in the series.
- **`/Resources`**: Additional resources, including helpful links and tutorials.

## Learning Objectives
1. Pick the right PCB materials (e.g., FR4, Rogers).
2. Design the layout of your PCB.
3. Prepare your PCB for manufacturing.

Whether for a hobby or a professional project, this series will help you turn your ideas into working circuit boards.
